Welcome to the Lex Programs Repository! This repository contains a collection of Lex programs designed for lexical analysis. Lex, also known as a lexical analyzer generator, is used to generate scanners, which are programs that perform lexical analysis. This process involves converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens.
